## DeepRL

Dumb code to trains computers through RL with policies optimized using Deep Neural Nets

Useless barely working sample for policy optimization using deep learning in [samples](samples/)

### To do:
1. Create a sample environment (kind of replicating [gymnasium](https://github.com/Farama-Foundation/Gymnasium))
2. Implement Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) on the created env.
